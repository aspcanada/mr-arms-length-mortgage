- Your funds must be transferred from your existing financial institution to a TD Waterhouse Self-Directed plan (RRSP accounts must end with an 'S', RRIF accounts must end with a 'T')
- With a minimum investment, we pay all administration fees for opening and maintaining the mortgage.
- We do not pay fees to liquidate existing investments within your RRSP/RRIF. These fees vary widely depending on the investment and must be paid by you.
- Interest accumulates (but does not compound) over the term.  The total interest payment is paid into the RRSP in a lump sum at the end of the term
- At the end of the term, we have the option to renew the mortgage for an additional term (specified above under 'Special Options').
- If we do not renew the term, the original borrowed funds are returned to the RRSP, along with all the accumulated interest.
- No tax liability is incurred by investing in an RRSP mortgage. The investment is still held within the RRSP.
