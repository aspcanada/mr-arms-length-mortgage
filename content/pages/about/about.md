# About Me

Hi there, my name is Alain St. Pierre, founder of Mr. Arm’s Length Mortgage and ASP Canada Real Estate Group.  My passion is to teach Canadians how to invest in mortgages using their RRSP’s (and other registered accounts). I’ve become the defacto “Arm’s Length Mortgage” guy, as Ranked #1 on Google and I receive 500+ hits per month on my blog.

I have experience in putting together RRSP mortgages and other creative financing strategies. I currently own 5 doors across Western Canada and continue to add to my personal real estate portfolio.

My passion in Real Estate Investing started when I bought my first property in 2007 and refinanced it two years later to pay off my student loans and bought out my JV partner. I still own the house and while I have no money into it, I continue to see it put money in my pocket! After seeing the potential to make money in Real Estate, I decided to educate myself. I’ve attended Real Estate Investing courses, read books and joined investment clubs and met a lot of great people along the way. I am a REIN Member and find myself expanding my context each and every day!

If you have any questions or comments, please don’t hesitate to contact me directly. I look forward to speaking with you!
