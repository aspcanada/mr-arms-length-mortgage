I believe Arm’s Length Mortgages are Canada’s Hidden Investment Gem! For the self-directed investor, who’s not satisfied with the returns on their current investments, loaning out money from their RRSP and being able to make their own rules seems almost too good to be true. But believe me – it is VERY true. Self-Directed Mortgages have been around for many years—this isn’t something new, but they are a little known product.
